# Crusader Kings 3 Expanded : *Traits-and-Events*

**Crusader Kings 3 Expanded** is an upcoming collection of mods for the CK3 game which fill focus on a wide variety of things from events, traits, to major implementations. 

As of now, Traits and Events is more or less of an introductory mod which should be fleshed out with time. 

There will mainly be medium to major event chains with each interlinked to one another using a large 'spider-web quest' format. 

## Large story chains

**Large story chains** will be fairly extensive with a few basic choices opened by certain traits/conditions. These in turn can turn the story chain in a variety of different directions depending on their previous chain choices, and even previous story chains. 

## Medium story chains 

**Medium story chains** will not be as extensive as it's large counterpart, but will still greatly affect the overall gameplay in terms of flavour with lasting effects.

## Small Story chains

**Small story chains** will mainly have a few choices here and there but can still impact the other two story chains. For example, the man you spared or helped may appear again in a later segment.
