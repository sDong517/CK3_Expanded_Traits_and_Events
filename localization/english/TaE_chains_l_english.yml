#Man or a Butterfly

TaE_events_chains.1001.t:0 "A man or a butterfly?"
TaE_events_chains.1001.desc:0 "I dreamed I was a butterfly, fluttering in the wind without a care in the world. As I was roused from my pleasant dream, I am left troubled in this waking world of what I had just dreamed. Did I dream of myself wanting to be a butterfly or was I a butterfly who is dreaming to be myself? I consulted with the most brilliant minds within my realm but to no avail."

TaE_events_chains.1002.desc:0 "Rumours are beginning to spread of their ruler spending hours in the study, searching for answers to some troubling dreams. Some are saying you are possessed, stricken with a madness by the gods for your sin, while others are beginning to form a cult in support of your beliefs. You are surprised that a simple dream had taken form in such magnitude, even more so that your dream is now circulating across the lands."

Curfew and censorship have been put in place, with soldiers patrolling the streets for graffiti and other manners of insult. The cult seems to have grown in size but no matter, I must find my answer one way or another!"

TaE_events_chains.1004.desc:0 "My followers grow everyday, with scholars and thinkers from all over coming to see this 'philosopher ruler', bearing gifts of both their knowledge and ancient texts. I have exhausted my own literary resources with little to no answers but it seems that I am not alone in my findings. Past philosophers have stumbled upon a similar subject much to my surprise and eventual annoyance, for there is no true answer. Maybe it was just a simple dream, or maybe this world is a dream. Regardless, I must now decide how to proceed."

You barely eat, drink, or even look at me!” I look at my spouse with a weak smile, perhaps there is more to life than what these texts say. “Here have something to eat.” I spent the rest of the day with my spouse, enjoying each other’s company and laughed for the first time in weeks. Life doesn’t have to be dull, it can be quite enjoyable it seems."

TaE_events_chains.1007.desc:0 "Alas, I have found it, the concept known to the ancients as existentialism. There is some truth and logic to this, but how cynical! Afterall, words still stem from men and men still have their own opinions. Nevertheless, this could be very useful… "

TaE_events_chains.1008.t:0 "A divine revelation"
TaE_events_chains.1008.desc:0 "It seems that my dream has become bigger than I have ever imagined with followers flocking by the hundreds per day. Beyond the monotony of daily life, this may have given people a chance to see past their sublime futures and into something greater than themselves and even greater than the heavens itself. For what is existence without purpose? This concept now known by the masses as existentialism is beginning to spread to neighboring rulers. Continuing this may prove to be both beneficial and dangerous, for an order on the lack of purpose smells like trouble… "

TaE_events_chains.1009.desc:0 "I have seized anyone and everyone that dared to question my authority, who gave them the rights to my vision? Peasants, they would suffer without my great authority. The stench of burning men and the sounds of wailing women and children is only a small price to true freedom, they do not need to think for themselves, I will do it for them. My own spouse refuses to see me anymore but what do I care, I can always get another one..."

TaE_events_chains.1010.desc:0 "Beyond all that has happened, the dream lingers at the back of my mind, taunting me as if I missed something. Is there something greater to life or am I just being delusional? A man, or a butterfly?"

#Ending 1
TaE_events_chains.1012.t:0 "The iron fist"
TaE_events_chains.1012.desc:0 "I see now, everything is clear to me from my dream. The world is cruel and so I must be cruel to survive! I will see to it that every man, woman, and child who went against me will be severely punished and those that continue to do so killed! A man or a butterfly? Neither! I am the keeper of peace and the keystone to stability, I am law itself!"
TaE_events_chains.1012.a:0 "Your subjects tremble at your presence, your actions have brought order, for now..."   

#Ending 2
TaE_events_chains.1013.t:0 "An end"

TaE_events_chains.1013.a:0 "Everything has a price"

#Ending 3
TaE_events_chains.1014.t:0 "Irony?"
TaE_events_chains.1014.desc:0 "Ironic isn’t it, how the people have united over the concept of existentialism. The people who have grown so selfish and greedy are already beginning to change slowly. The poor and the sick are given care by passerbyers, the city is changing. A simple dream of a butterfly changing the course of history, fluttering hither and thither. But truly, am I a man or a butterfly?"

#Ending 4 
TaE_events_chains.1015.t:0 "The little things in life."
TaE_events_chains.1015.desc:0 "I shouldn't dwell on things that are of not the uptmost importance. To enjoy the company of your spouse, now that is far more important than some menial dream. Life, can be good."
TaE_events_chains.1015.a:0 "Perhaps I can relax a little longer..."
